# Music-Genre-Classification
Using deep learning, CNN neural networks and the GTZAN data set, we designed a system capable of recognizing 10 genres.

Note that we did not upload the data-set but if you are interested see the neural network architecture just check the NN folder...
To run the project just run the main.py file. Read the article code below to better understand: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347356900_Audio_Pre-Processing_For_Deep_Learning 

If you have any ideas or criticism to improve the code, be sure to share with us.
